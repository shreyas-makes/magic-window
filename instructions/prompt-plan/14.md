Objective: Switch to HEVC encoding, optimize performance to meet targets, and implement pause/resume functionality.

Context: Integrating all features developed so far. Focus on core spec requirements.

Task:
1.  **HEVC Encoding (Renderer `renderer.js`):**
    * **Check Support:** Before creating `MediaRecorder`, check if HEVC is supported with hardware acceleration potential: `MediaRecorder.isTypeSupported('video/mp4; codecs=hvc1')` or `video/mp4; codecs=hevc`. Log the result.
    * **Configure MediaRecorder:** If supported, instantiate `MediaRecorder` with the HEVC MIME type: `new MediaRecorder(canvasStream, { mimeType: 'video/mp4; codecs=hvc1', videoBitsPerSecond: 20000000 });` (Adjust bitrate as needed for 4K/60FPS, maybe 20-40 Mbps). If HEVC is not supported, fall back to H.264 (`avc1`) and log a warning.
2.  **Performance Optimization:**
    * **Profiling:** Use Chrome DevTools (for renderer) and Node.js profiler/Activity Monitor (for main) to identify bottlenecks during recording, especially with zoom active.
    * **Renderer (`renderer.js`):**
        * Optimize Pixi.js rendering: Ensure textures are updated efficiently, avoid unnecessary object creation in the update loop. Check `videoSprite` texture updates.
        * Throttle snapshot generation for PiP ('pipFrameUpdate') if it impacts performance (e.g., send every 500ms instead of 250ms).
        * Review IPC usage: Ensure large data isn't sent too frequently. Blob chunk sending should be okay.
    * **Main Process (`main.js`):**
        * Optimize segment saving: Ensure disk I/O is efficient. Using async file operations (`fs.promises`) might help responsiveness but ensure order is maintained for segments. `fs.writeFileSync` might be okay if fast enough.
        * Optimize ffmpeg concatenation: Ensure the chosen concat method is efficient for fragmented MP4.
    * **Targets:** Aim for CPU ≤30% (baseline recording), ≤40% (with zoom); GPU ≤30% (with zoom); RAM +≤500MB (zoom); Dropped frames ≤0.5% (analyze recorder stats or final file). Test on M1 Pro.
3.  **Pause/Resume Implementation:**
    * **Renderer (`renderer.js`):**
        * Implement 'pauseRecording' handler: If recording and not paused, call `mediaRecorder.pause()`, set `isPaused = true`, update state (incl. timer stop), and send state update via IPC.
        * Implement 'resumeRecording' handler: If recording and paused, call `mediaRecorder.resume()`, set `isPaused = false`, update state (incl. timer resume), and send state update via IPC.
    * **Main Process (`main.js`):**
        * Handle pause/resume state updates from renderer if needed (e.g., maybe stop disk space check when paused).
        * Ensure concatenation works correctly with recordings that have been paused/resumed. (Fragmented MP4 and `MediaRecorder` pause/resume should handle this okay).
    * **Hotkey (`main.js`):** Modify the `Cmd+Shift+9` hotkey logic:
        * If not recording: Start.
        * If recording and not paused: Pause.
        * If recording and paused: Resume.
        * *(Need a separate Stop action now - maybe dedicated button or different hotkey? Specification only mentions ⌘⇧9 for Start · Pause · Resume · Stop. This implies a cycle. Let's try: Start -> Pause -> Resume -> Pause -> ... How to stop? Add a dedicated Stop button.)*
        * **Revised Hotkey Logic:** Start -> Pause -> Resume -> Pause ... (Stop via UI button). Send appropriate 'pauseRecording'/'resumeRecording' commands to renderer.
    * **UI (`index.html`, `renderer.js`, `panel.html`, `panelRenderer.js`):**
        * Ensure UI buttons (main window, potentially panel) correctly reflect and control Pause/Resume states.
        * Add a dedicated "Stop" button to the main UI, wired to the 'stopRecording' IPC message. Ensure panel controls don't offer 'Stop'.

Requirements:
* Attempt HEVC encoding; fall back to H.264 if unsupported.
* Profile and optimize to meet CPU/GPU/RAM/frame drop targets on M1 Pro.
* Implement `MediaRecorder.pause()` and `resume()`.
* Update UI and hotkey (`Cmd+Shift+9` for Start/Pause/Resume cycle) to reflect pause state.
* Add a dedicated Stop button.

Testing:
* Describe manual/TDD verification:
    * Verify recordings use HEVC if possible (check file info).
    * Monitor Activity Monitor/DevTools during recording with and without zoom. Check if performance targets are met. Record for 2 hours and check for dropped frames (<0.5%).
    * Start recording. Press `Cmd+Shift+9` - verify it pauses (timer stops, UI updates). Press again - verify it resumes.
    * Use UI Pause/Resume buttons. Verify they work.
    * Record a video with several pause/resume cycles. Stop using the Stop button. Verify the final concatenated video plays smoothly through the pauses.

Output: Provide updated code for `main.js`, `preload.js`, `renderer.js`, `index.html`, potentially panel files. Include notes on profiling techniques.
