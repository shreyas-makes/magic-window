Objective: Implement functionality to list available screen and window sources for recording.

Context: Building upon the basic Electron app structure from Prompt 1.

Task:
1.  **Main Process (`main.js`):**
    * Import the `desktopCapturer` module.
    * Create an IPC handler (`ipcMain.handle`) for a 'getSources' request.
    * Inside the handler, call `desktopCapturer.getSources({ types: ['window', 'screen'] })`.
    * Return the list of sources to the renderer.
    * Add another IPC handler (`ipcMain.on`) for a 'sourceSelected' message, which simply logs the received source ID for now.
2.  **Preload Script (`preload.js`):**
    * Expose the 'getSources' invoker and the 'sourceSelected' sender via the `contextBridge` under `electronAPI`.
3.  **Renderer Process (`renderer.js` & `index.html`):**
    * Add a `<select>` dropdown element to `index.html` to display sources. Add a "Refresh Sources" button.
    * In `renderer.js`, create a function `populateSources` that:
        * Calls the `electronAPI.getSources()` method.
        * Clears the dropdown.
        * Populates the dropdown with the received sources (displaying `source.name`, using `source.id` as the value).
    * Call `populateSources` when the app loads and when the "Refresh Sources" button is clicked.
    * Add an event listener to the dropdown (`change` event) that calls `electronAPI.sourceSelected(selectedSourceId)` with the chosen source ID.

Requirements:
* List both screens and windows.
* Use `ipcMain.handle` for request/response logic (getSources).
* Update the `electronAPI` exposure in `preload.js`.

Testing:
* Write TDD-style tests (conceptual or using a testing framework like Spectron/Playwright if possible, otherwise describe manual verification steps):
    * Verify that invoking 'getSources' from the renderer results in the main process calling `desktopCapturer.getSources`.
    * Verify the dropdown in the UI is populated with source names after app load or refresh.
    * Verify that selecting a source in the dropdown triggers the 'sourceSelected' IPC message with the correct source ID, logged in the main process.

Output: Provide updated code for `main.js`, `preload.js`, `index.html`, and `renderer.js`.
