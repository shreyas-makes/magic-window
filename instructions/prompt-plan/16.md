Objective: Set up the build process using electron-builder, configure code signing and notarization for macOS, and perform final integration tests.

Context: The application features are complete and sandboxed. Preparing for distribution.

Task:
1.  **Build Setup (`electron-builder`):**
    * Install `electron-builder` as a dev dependency (`npm install electron-builder --save-dev`).
    * Configure `package.json` for `electron-builder`:
        * Add `build` configuration section.
        * Specify `appId`.
        * Configure `mac` target (`target: ['dmg', 'zip']`).
        * Set `category: 'public.app-category.utilities'` or similar.
        * Configure `files` array to include necessary assets (HTML, JS, CSS, preload scripts, maybe `ffmpeg-static` binary if bundled). Exclude source files, node_modules source, etc.
        * **Hardened Runtime & Entitlements:** Enable hardened runtime (`"hardenedRuntime": true`). Create an `entitlements.mac.plist` file with necessary entitlements:
            * `com.apple.security.app-sandbox: true`
            * `com.apple.security.device.camera: true` (Might be needed for screen capture/getUserMedia) - *Verify if needed for desktopCapture*. Typically needed for camera, maybe not screen. Start without if possible.
            * `com.apple.security.device.microphone: false` (Assuming no audio yet).
            * `com.apple.security.files.user-selected.read-write: true` (For saving recordings via dialog).
            * `com.apple.security.files.bookmarks.app-scope: true` (Needed to retain access to user-selected folders across launches in sandbox).
            * *Crucially:* Need entitlement for `desktopCapture`? Check Electron docs. Might not need explicit device access if using API correctly.
        * Reference the entitlements file: `"entitlements": "entitlements.mac.plist", "entitlementsInherit": "entitlements.mac.plist"`.
        * **FFmpeg:** Ensure `ffmpeg-static` binary is correctly included in the packaged app (using `extraResources` or similar in `build` config) and `fluent-ffmpeg` is pointed to the packaged path at runtime. `process.resourcesPath`.
    * Add build scripts to `package.json`: `"pack": "electron-builder --dir"`, `"dist": "electron-builder"`.
2.  **Code Signing & Notarization:**
    * **Requirements:** Apple Developer ID Application certificate installed in Keychain. App-specific password for notarization.
    * **Configuration (`build` section in `package.json`):**
        * Configure `mac.identity`: Set to your "Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)" or use `null` to allow auto-discovery (requires correct cert in keychain). Set `CSC_LINK` and `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD` env vars if using cert file/password. Best practice is Keychain access.
        * Configure `mac.notarize`: Set to `true` (or configure object with `appleId`, `appleIdPassword`, `teamId`). Store credentials securely (e.g., environment variables `APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_ID_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_TEAM_ID`), *not* in `package.json`.
3.  **Security Scoped Bookmarks (Sandboxing Persistence):**
    * **Main Process (`main.js`):**
        * When the user selects a save directory using `dialog.showOpenDialog`, the returned path is temporary in sandbox. To retain access:
            * Store the *bookmark data* created from the path using `app.startAccessingSecurityScopedResource(filePath)` (requires Electron >= 9/10+, check exact API) or native macOS modules. This is complex.
            * **Simpler (but less secure) Alternative for MVP:** Store the *path* using `electron-store`. On app start, *re-prompt* the user for the folder if the stored path exists but access fails, guiding them to select the same one. This avoids bookmark complexity for now but isn't ideal UX.
            * **Let's try the bookmark approach:** When dialog returns path: `const bookmark = app.startAccessingSecurityScopedResource(path); store.set('savePathBookmark', bookmark); store.set('savePath', path);` (Need to store both for display).
            * On startup: Read `savePathBookmark`. If exists, try to resolve it: `const resolvedPath = app.resolveSecurityScopedResource(savePathBookmark);` If successful, use `resolvedPath`. Store this resolved path in `currentSavePath`. Remember to call `app.stopAccessingSecurityScopedResource()` when done with the path or on quit. This needs careful management. *Error handling is critical here.* If resolution fails, clear the stored bookmark/path and default to Movies.
4.  **Final Integration Testing:**
    * Run `npm run dist` to build the DMG/zip.
    * Install the app from the DMG on a clean machine (or different user account).
    * Perform comprehensive testing covering all specification points:
        * Core recording (4K/60, HEVC, performance, duration, dropped frames).
        * All recording controls (source select, hotkey, buttons, save folder persistence via bookmarks).
        * All zoom functionality (controls, panel, PiP, shortcuts, mouse, presets, border effect, performance during zoom).
        * Storage (naming, structure, segmentation, concat, disk warning, recovery).
        * Accessibility (VoiceOver).
        * Sandboxing (confirm it's running sandboxed - check Activity Monitor).
        * Test on multiple monitors.
        * Test with other apps running.
        * Check Console.app for any errors.

Requirements:
* Configure `electron-builder` for macOS (dmg, zip).
* Enable Hardened Runtime and configure necessary entitlements for sandboxing (especially file access).
* Set up Code Signing and Notarization using environment variables for credentials.
* Implement security-scoped bookmarks for persistent save folder access in sandbox.
* Bundle ffmpeg correctly.
* Perform final end-to-end testing on the built, notarized app.

Testing:
* Verify the build process completes successfully, creating signed and notarized DMG/zip files.
* Install from DMG. macOS Gatekeeper should verify it.
* Verify save folder selection persists across app restarts using bookmarks.
* Pass all integration tests from the specification document on the final build.

Output: Provide updated `package.json` (build scripts and config), `entitlements.mac.plist`, updated `main.js` (for bookmarks and ffmpeg path), and notes on environment variables needed for notarization.
