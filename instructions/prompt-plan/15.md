Objective: Implement VoiceOver accessibility, robust error handling, basic crash recovery, and prepare for sandboxing.

Context: Polishing the application before final testing and packaging.

Task:
1.  **Accessibility (VoiceOver):**
    * **All UI Files (`index.html`, `panel.html`):** Review all interactive elements (buttons, selects, canvas elements that have interactions like PiP).
        * Ensure buttons have clear, descriptive text or `aria-label`.
        * Ensure dropdowns have associated labels.
        * For custom controls (like PiP canvas drag), consider adding ARIA roles and properties if applicable, or at least ensure surrounding elements provide context. Status indicators (timer, zoom level) should ideally use `aria-live` regions so updates are announced.
    * **Testing:** Manually enable VoiceOver on macOS and navigate the entire application using keyboard and VoiceOver commands. Verify all controls are reachable, identifiable, and usable.
2.  **Error Handling:**
    * **Renderer (`renderer.js`):** Wrap critical sections (`getUserMedia`, `MediaRecorder` setup/calls, Pixi operations, IPC calls) in `try...catch` blocks. Log errors descriptively (`console.error`). Handle `mediaRecorder.onerror` event, log the error, maybe stop recording and notify user.
    * **Main Process (`main.js`):** Wrap critical sections (IPC handlers, file system operations (`fs`), `ffmpeg` calls, `dialog`, `globalShortcut`, `store`) in `try...catch`. Log errors (consider logging to a file using `electron-log` or similar). Use `dialog.showErrorBox` for critical user-facing errors (e.g., save failure, ffmpeg failure).
    * **Zoom Performance Errors:** If FPS drops below threshold (Prompt 9), display a non-modal warning notification in the UI (e.g., a temporary banner) in addition to logging.
3.  **Crash Recovery:**
    * **Main Process (`main.js`):**
        * On app startup, *before* cleaning any old temp files: Check the OS temporary directory for any leftover `tempSessionDir` folders from this app (e.g., look for folders matching a pattern).
        * If found:
            * Use `dialog.showMessageBox` to ask the user if they want to attempt recovery of the recording found in that directory.
            * If yes: Trigger the concatenation logic (`fluent-ffmpeg`) on the segments found in that directory, saving to the user's chosen save path (or default). Handle success/error messages for the recovery attempt. Ensure the recovered file gets a unique name (maybe add "-recovered").
            * Whether recovery is attempted or not, *delete the old temp directory* after handling it.
4.  **Sandboxing Preparation:**
    * **Review (`main.js`, `renderer.js`, `preload.js`):**
        * Confirm `contextIsolation: true` and `nodeIntegration: false` for all `webPreferences`.
        * Ensure *no* Node.js modules (`fs`, `path`, etc.) or Electron APIs (`dialog`, etc.) are directly called from renderer JS (`renderer.js`, `panelRenderer.js`). All such access *must* go through the preload script (`contextBridge`) calling IPC methods handled in the main process. Review all renderer code for violations.
        * List all Node/Electron APIs used via IPC (e.g., `fs.writeFileSync`, `fs.mkdirSync`, `fs.rmSync`, `fs.mkdtemp`, `dialog.showOpenDialog`, `dialog.showMessageBox`, `dialog.showErrorBox`, `desktopCapturer.getSources`, `checkDiskSpace`, `ffmpeg`, `store.get/set`, `app.getPath`).
    * **Main Process (`main.js`):** Call `app.enableSandbox()` early in the main process execution (before app 'ready').
    * **Testing:** Run the app with the sandbox enabled. Test *all* functionality, especially file saving, folder selection, recovery, ffmpeg concatenation, source listing. Fix any errors arising from sandbox restrictions (likely by ensuring renderer is only using exposed preload APIs).

Requirements:
* All UI controls should be accessible via VoiceOver.
* Implement comprehensive `try...catch` and event-based error handling, logging errors, and showing critical messages to the user.
* Offer recovery option for recordings interrupted by crashes.
* Enable Electron's sandbox (`app.enableSandbox()`).
* Ensure all renderer access to privileged APIs goes through preload/IPC.

Testing:
* Describe manual/TDD verification:
    * Perform full VoiceOver walkthrough.
    * Simulate errors: Invalid save path, delete ffmpeg binary temporarily, corrupt segment file before concat. Verify errors are handled gracefully.
    * Simulate crash: Start recording, kill main process, restart app. Verify recovery prompt appears and works (or fails gracefully if segments are bad).
    * Test ALL application features thoroughly with `app.enableSandbox()` active. Verify everything still works.

Output: Provide updated code for `main.js`, `preload.js`, `renderer.js`, `panelRenderer.js`, `index.html`, `panel.html`. Add notes on VoiceOver testing and sandboxing confirmations. Mention `electron-log` as optional dependency for file logging.
