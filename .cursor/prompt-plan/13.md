Objective: Implement the pulsing gradient border effect on the main canvas and the PiP navigator, indicating original and zoomed boundaries.

Context: Building upon the zoom engine and PiP navigator from Prompt 12.

Task:
1.  **Main Renderer (`renderer.js` - Pixi):**
    * **Border Graphics:**
        * Create a `PIXI.Graphics` object and add it to the main stage (`app.stage`).
        * In the update loop (`app.ticker`):
            * Clear the graphics object (`borderGraphics.clear()`).
            * **Outer Border (Original Bounds):** Draw a rectangle representing the full canvas bounds (0, 0, canvasW, canvasH). Use a specific line style (thickness, maybe a subtle color or dashed). This border might be optional if the canvas edge is clear enough. Let's make it subtle or skip if not strictly needed by the "Magic Window" concept which focuses on the *zoomed* area.
            * **Inner Border (Zoomed Area):** Draw a rectangle representing the *visible portion* of the scaled `videoSprite`. This requires calculating the intersection of the scaled sprite's bounds with the canvas bounds.
                * Calculate the top-left (vx, vy) and bottom-right (vx+vw, vy+vh) corners of the *visible* part of the video texture *in canvas coordinates*.
                * Top-left: `(max(0, videoSprite.x - videoSprite.pivot.x * videoSprite.scale.x), max(0, videoSprite.y - videoSprite.pivot.y * videoSprite.scale.y))` - Adjust based on how pivot/position works.
                * Bottom-right: `(min(canvasW, topLeftX + textureW * scaleX), min(canvasH, topLeftY + textureH * scaleY))` - This needs careful calculation based on the applied transforms.
                * Let's simplify: If the zoom rectangle calculation for the PiP is correct, use those scaled-up coordinates. `borderX = pipRectX * scaleFactor`, `borderY = pipRectY * scaleFactor`, `borderW = pipRectW * scaleFactor`, `borderH = pipRectH * scaleFactor`, where `scaleFactor = canvasW / pipCanvasW`.
            * **Gradient & Pulsing:**
                * Drawing a gradient border directly in `PIXI.Graphics` might require drawing multiple lines or using shaders.
                * **Simpler approach:** Use a solid color line first. `borderGraphics.lineStyle(thickness, color, alpha); borderGraphics.drawRect(borderX, borderY, borderW, borderH);`
                * For pulsing: Animate the `alpha` of the line style using `gsap` or `app.ticker` (e.g., `alpha = 0.5 + Math.sin(Date.now() * 0.005) * 0.5`).
                * For gradient: This really suggests using a shader applied to the graphics object or drawing a textured mesh/sprite.
                * **Compromise:** Implement a single-color pulsing border first (e.g., purple). Acknowledge gradient requires shaders as a future enhancement if needed. Use a thicker line (e.g., 4-6px).
2.  **Panel Renderer (`panelRenderer.js` - PiP):**
    * Similarly, create a `PIXI.Graphics` object for the PiP stage.
    * In its update loop or when the zoom rectangle is redrawn:
        * Clear the PiP border graphics.
        * Draw the zoom rectangle using `lineStyle` with the same pulsing color/alpha logic as the main border.

Requirements:
* Draw a border on the main canvas corresponding to the current zoomed viewport boundaries.
* This border should pulse in intensity/alpha.
* Use a distinct color (e.g., purple) for the border.
* Draw a similar pulsing border around the zoom rectangle on the PiP navigator.
* Acknowledge gradient is deferred (requires shaders).

Testing:
* Describe manual/TDD verification:
    * Start recording and zoom in. Verify a visible border appears around the edge of the zoomed area on the main canvas.
    * Verify the border pulses smoothly (e.g., fades in/out).
    * Verify the border accurately tracks the zoomed area as you pan using the PiP.
    * Verify the rectangle drawn on the PiP *also* has a similar pulsing border effect.

Output: Provide updated code for `renderer.js` and `panelRenderer.js`.
