Objective: Implement basic digital zoom functionality on the WebGL canvas.

Context: Building upon the Pixi.js canvas rendering and recording setup from Prompt 7.

Task:
1.  **Renderer Process (`renderer.js`):**
    * **State Variables:** Add state variables: `zoomLevel` (default 1.0), `zoomCenterX` (default canvas_width / 2), `zoomCenterY` (default canvas_height / 2).
    * **Pixi Transformation:**
        * Locate the `videoSprite` created earlier.
        * In an update loop (e.g., using `app.ticker` or `requestAnimationFrame` if not using Pixi Application ticker):
            * Calculate the required scale based on `zoomLevel`. The sprite should be scaled *up* (`videoSprite.scale.set(zoomLevel)`).
            * Calculate the required position offset to keep the `(zoomCenterX, zoomCenterY)` point of the *original video texture* at the center of the canvas. This involves setting the sprite's pivot point and position:
                * `videoSprite.pivot.set(zoomCenterX / zoomLevel, zoomCenterY / zoomLevel);` // Check if pivot coords are in original texture space or scaled space - adjust accordingly. Assume original texture space needed for pivot. Let's refine: Pivot should be the point *in the sprite's texture* that stays fixed at the sprite's position. Position should be the canvas center.
                * Let target canvas center be `(canvasW/2, canvasH/2)`.
                * The texture point `(zoomCenterX, zoomCenterY)` should map to the canvas center.
                * Sprite position calculation: `videoSprite.x = canvasW / 2 - zoomCenterX * zoomLevel;` ? No, that moves the top-left.
                * Try setting the pivot point *of the sprite* to the desired zoom center *in texture coordinates*, and then positioning the sprite so its pivot point is at the canvas center.
                * `videoSprite.pivot.set(zoomCenterX, zoomCenterY);`
                * `videoSprite.position.set(canvasW / 2, canvasH / 2);`
                * `videoSprite.scale.set(zoomLevel);`
                * Experiment to get the correct transform. The goal is: scaling the sprite by `zoomLevel` and translating it so the point `(zoomCenterX, zoomCenterY)` within the original video appears at the center `(canvasW / 2, canvasH / 2)` of the canvas.
    * **Test Controls:** Add temporary buttons or key listeners in the renderer to:
        * Set `zoomLevel` to 2.0.
        * Set `zoomLevel` back to 1.0.
        * Change `zoomCenterX`, `zoomCenterY` (e.g., move focus to top-left quarter).

Requirements:
* Apply scale and translation to the Pixi.js sprite based on zoom level and center variables.
* Ensure the output canvas remains 4K.
* Implement basic bilinear filtering (Pixi.js default usually).

Testing:
* Describe manual/TDD verification:
    * With the app running and rendering a source, use the temporary controls:
        * Set zoom to 2.0. Verify the canvas view zooms in, centered correctly.
        * Change the zoom center. Verify the zoomed view pans accordingly.
        * Reset zoom to 1.0. Verify the view returns to normal.
    * Record a short clip while changing zoom levels. Verify the *recorded output* reflects the zoomed/panned view seen on the canvas.

Output: Provide updated code for `renderer.js` and potentially `index.html` (for temporary controls). Include the correct Pixi.js transformation logic.
