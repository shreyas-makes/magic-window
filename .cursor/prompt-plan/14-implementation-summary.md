# Implementation Summary for Magic Window @14.md

## 1. HEVC Encoding

- **HEVC Support Check**: Implemented a prioritized codec check that first looks for HEVC support (`hvc1` and `hevc` variants)
- **Codec Fallback**: Added a graceful fallback to H.264 and then other codecs when HEVC is not available
- **Bitrate Configuration**: Optimized bitrates based on codec (20 Mbps for HEVC, 30 Mbps for H.264)
- **Detailed Logging**: Added extensive logging to track which codec is actually being used
- **Error Handling**: Improved error handling for codec initialization failures

## 2. Performance Optimization

- **Profiling & Metrics**: Added performance monitoring to track FPS, frame times, and dropped frames
- **Pixi.js Rendering Optimization**:
  - Implemented frame skipping during recording
  - Throttled texture updates to reduce CPU usage
  - Optimized border effect rendering during recording
  - Adjusted interpolation parameters for smoother zooming
- **PiP Snapshot Optimization**:
  - Increased throttling interval during recording (750ms vs 250ms)
  - Reduced snapshot resolution during recording (20% vs 40%)
  - Used lower JPEG quality during recording
  - Optimized canvas rendering with better context options
- **Memory Monitoring**: Added tracking of JS heap size to detect potential memory leaks
- **Recording Segment Size**: Optimized segment sizes (5s) for better recovery potential and reduced overhead

## 3. Pause/Resume Implementation

- **MediaRecorder Integration**:
  - Enhanced pause/resume functions with proper state checking
  - Added detailed error handling and logging
- **UI State Management**:
  - Properly updated local state variables
  - Synchronized timer with pause/resume state
  - Ensured proper IPC communication with main process
- **Hotkey Implementation**:
  - Updated to use Cmd+Shift+9 as specified
  - Implemented cycling behavior: Start→Pause→Resume→Pause...
  - Added clear logging of current cycle state
- **Testing Support**:
  - Detailed state logging for debugging
  - Proper checks for MediaRecorder state transitions

## Performance Targets

This implementation addresses the performance targets specified in @14.md:
- CPU usage: Optimized for ≤30% during baseline recording, ≤40% with zoom
- Dropped frames: Added monitoring to detect when they exceed 0.5%
- Memory usage: Added tracking to ensure we stay within +≤500MB during zoom
- Media segments: Optimized for reliable recording and efficient concatenation

## Conclusion

All requirements from @14.md have been implemented. The application now:
1. Prioritizes HEVC encoding with proper fallback
2. Includes comprehensive performance optimizations
3. Supports pause/resume functionality via UI and hotkeys
4. Monitors performance to ensure it meets targets
5. Provides detailed logging for debugging and verification

The implementation is ready for testing to verify that it meets the stated performance targets on an M1 Pro MacBook.
