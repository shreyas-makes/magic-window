Objective: Set up a basic Electron 35 project structure for a macOS screen recorder app.

Task:
1.  Initialize a new Node.js project.
2.  Add Electron v35 as a dependency.
3.  Create a `main.js` file that:
    * Imports necessary Electron modules (`app`, `BrowserWindow`, `ipcMain`, `screen`).
    * Creates a main `BrowserWindow` with responsive dimensions (80% of screen size).
    * Centers the window on the screen.
    * Loads an `index.html` file into the window.
    * Includes basic lifecycle management (quit when all windows closed, activate handling).
    * Sets up a basic preload script (`preload.js`).
4.  Create an `index.html` file with a simple heading (e.g., "Magic Window Recorder") and include `renderer.js`.
5.  Create a `renderer.js` file.
6.  Create `preload.js` that exposes a basic `ipcRenderer.send` and `ipcRenderer.on` mechanism safely using `contextBridge`. Name the exposed API `electronAPI`.
7.  Implement a simple IPC test: Renderer sends a "ping" message on load, Main logs "ping received" and sends back "pong", Renderer logs "pong received".
8.  Provide basic `package.json` scripts for starting the app (`"start": "electron ."`).

Requirements:
* Use Electron 35.
* Follow standard Electron project structure.
* Ensure `contextIsolation` is enabled (default) and use `contextBridge` for preload exposure.
* Window should be responsive to screen size.

Testing:
* Write instructions or assertions to verify:
    * The app launches and displays the main window with the heading.
    * The window is centered and sized appropriately for the screen.
    * The "ping" and "pong" messages are correctly logged in the main process console and renderer dev console, respectively.

Output: Provide the content for `package.json`, `main.js`, `preload.js`, `index.html`, and `renderer.js`.
