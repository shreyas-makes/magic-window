Objective: Implement the Picture-in-Picture (PiP) navigator in the floating panel, showing the full view and allowing click-and-drag to change the main zoom area.

Context: Building upon the floating panel and zoom controls from Prompt 11.

Task:
1.  **Floating Panel (`panel.html`, `panelRenderer.js`, CSS):**
    * **HTML:** Add a container `div#pip-container` and inside it a `<canvas id="pip-canvas"></canvas>`. Style the container and canvas (e.g., fixed size like 100x56 assuming 16:9, border). Initially hidden.
    * **Pixi for PiP:**
        * In `panelRenderer.js`, set up a *second* `PIXI.Application` attached to `#pip-canvas`.
        * We need the original video stream here too. This is tricky.
            * **Option A (IPC Stream):** Can we efficiently stream frames from main renderer -> main -> panel renderer? Likely too slow/complex.
            * **Option B (Re-capture):** Can the panel renderer also call `getUserMedia` for the same source? Might work but seems redundant/inefficient.
            * **Option C (Snapshot):** Main renderer periodically sends a downscaled snapshot of the *original* video frame (before zoom) via IPC to the panel. Panel draws this snapshot image to the PiP canvas. Let's try this.
    * **Snapshot Sending (Main Renderer `renderer.js`):**
        * Create an offscreen canvas or use Pixi's `extract` functionality to get the *original* unzoomed video frame.
        * Downscale it significantly (e.g., to 200px width).
        * Convert to a data URL (`toDataURL`).
        * Send this data URL via IPC ('pipFrameUpdate') to main process, perhaps every 250ms (throttled).
    * **Snapshot Receiving (Main Process `main.js`):**
        * Relay the 'pipFrameUpdate' message with the data URL to the `floatingPanelWindow`.
    * **Snapshot Display (Panel Renderer `panelRenderer.js`):**
        * Listen for 'pipFrameUpdate' via `panelAPI`.
        * When a data URL is received, create a `PIXI.Texture` from it (`PIXI.Texture.fromURL(dataURL)`).
        * Create/update a `PIXI.Sprite` on the PiP stage with this texture. Size it to fit the PiP canvas. Handle texture loading/updates carefully.
    * **Zoom Rectangle Drawing:**
        * The main renderer needs to send its current zoom state (`currentZoom`, `currentCenterX`, `currentCenterY`, `canvasWidth`, `canvasHeight`) via IPC whenever it changes ('zoomStateUpdate'). Main relays this to panel.
        * In `panelRenderer.js`, listen for 'zoomStateUpdate'.
        * Draw a rectangle (`PIXI.Graphics`) on the PiP canvas representing the zoomed area:
            * Calculate the rectangle's top-left corner (x, y) and its width/height based on the received zoom state and the PiP canvas dimensions relative to the full 4K canvas dimensions.
            * `(x, y)` = `(centerX - (canvasW / zoom / 2), centerY - (canvasH / zoom / 2))` scaled down to PiP size.
            * `(width, height)` = `(canvasW / zoom, canvasH / zoom)` scaled down to PiP size.
            * Style the rectangle (e.g., semi-transparent fill or border). Update it whenever zoom state changes.
    * **Click/Drag Interaction:**
        * Add mouse event listeners (`mousedown`, `mousemove`, `mouseup`) to the PiP canvas.
        * On `mousedown`, set a flag `isDraggingPip = true`. Calculate the clicked position within the PiP canvas. Convert this position to the corresponding *center* coordinates in the full 4K texture space. Send a 'setZoomCenter' command via IPC with these coordinates (to main, then relayed to main renderer).
        * On `mousemove`, if `isDraggingPip` is true, repeat the calculation and sending of 'setZoomCenter'.
        * On `mouseup`, set `isDraggingPip = false`.
    * **Toggle PiP:**
        * Implement the 'togglePip' listener in the main renderer (received from panel via main): Toggle a boolean state `isPipVisible`.
        * Main renderer sends this state back via main to the panel ('pipStateUpdate').
        * Panel renderer listens for 'pipStateUpdate' and shows/hides the `#pip-container` div accordingly. Update the PiP toggle button appearance.
        * Implement the `Cmd+0` shortcut in main process to send 'togglePip' command to main renderer.
2.  **Main Renderer (`renderer.js`):**
    * Implement snapshot generation and sending ('pipFrameUpdate').
    * Implement zoom state sending ('zoomStateUpdate').
    * Implement listener for 'setZoomCenter' command: Call `setZoom(currentZoom, newCenterX, newCenterY)` to smoothly move the view.
    * Implement 'togglePip' handler and state.
3.  **Main Process (`main.js`):**
    * Add relays for 'pipFrameUpdate', 'zoomStateUpdate', 'setZoomCenter', 'pipStateUpdate'.
    * Register `Cmd+0` global shortcut to send 'togglePip' to main renderer.

Requirements:
* PiP canvas in the panel shows a downscaled, throttled preview of the original unzoomed source.
* A rectangle on the PiP accurately represents the current zoomed viewport.
* Clicking/dragging on the PiP canvas smoothly updates the main view's zoom center.
* PiP visibility can be toggled via panel button and `Cmd+0`.

Testing:
* Describe manual/TDD verification:
    * Toggle PiP on/off using button and shortcut. Verify it appears/disappears.
    * Verify PiP shows a recognizable (if slightly delayed) preview of the source.
    * Zoom in/out on the main view. Verify the rectangle on the PiP changes size/position correctly.
    * Click and drag within the PiP. Verify the main zoomed view pans smoothly to follow the PiP interaction.

Output: Provide updated code for `main.js`, `preload.js`, `renderer.js`, `panel.html`, `preloadPanel.js`, `panelRenderer.js`. Include necessary CSS for PiP.
